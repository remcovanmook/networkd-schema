When the mode is set to 'static', an IPv6 address must be specified after a colon (':'), and the lower bits of the supplied address are combined with the upper bits of a prefix received in a Router Advertisement (RA) message to form a complete address. Note that if multiple prefixes are received in an RA message, or in multiple RA messages, addresses will be formed from each of them using the supplied address. This mode implements SLAAC but uses a static interface identifier instead of an identifier generated by using the EUI-64 algorithm. Because the interface identifier is static, if Duplicate Address Detection detects that the computed address is a duplicate (in use by another node on the link), then this mode will fail to provide an address for that prefix. If an IPv6 address without mode is specified, then 'static' mode is assumed. When the mode is set to 'prefixstable' the RFC 7217 algorithm for generating interface identifiers will be used. This mode can optionally take an IPv6 address separated with a colon (':'). If an IPv6 address is specified, then an interface identifier is generated only when a prefix received in an RA message matches the supplied address. If no address generation mode is specified (which is the default), or a received prefix does not match any of the addresses provided in 'prefixstable' mode, then the EUI-64 algorithm will be used to form an interface identifier for that prefix. This mode is also SLAAC, but with a potentially stable interface identifier which does not directly map to the interface's hardware address. Note that the 'prefixstable' algorithm uses both the interface name and MAC address as input to the hash to compute the interface identifier, so if either of those are changed the resulting interface identifier (and address) will change, even if the prefix received in the RA message has not changed. This setting can be specified multiple times. If an empty string is assigned, then the all previous assignments are cleared. Examples: IPv6Token=::1a:2b:3c:4d IPv6Token=static:::1a:2b:3c:4d IPv6Token=prefixstable IPv6Token=prefixstable:2002:da8:1::"

The LLDP packet will contain information about the local hostname, the local machine ID (as stored in machine-id5) and the local interface name, as well as the pretty hostname of the system (as set in machine-info5). LLDP emission is only available on Ethernet links. Note that this setting passes data suitable for identification of host to the network and should thus not be enabled on untrusted networks, where such identification data should not be made available. Use this option to permit other systems to identify on which interfaces they are connected to this system. The three special values control propagation of the LLDP packets. The 'nearest-bridge' setting permits propagation only to the nearest connected bridge, 'non-tpmr-bridge' permits propagation across Two-Port MAC Relays, but not any other bridges, and 'customer-bridge' permits propagation until a customer bridge is reached. For details about these concepts, see IEEE 802.1AB-2016. Note that configuring this setting to true is equivalent to 'nearest-bridge', the recommended and most restricted level of propagation.

Each item in the list should be a domain name, optionally prefixed with a tilde ('~'). The domains with the prefix are called \"routing-only domains\". The domains without the prefix are called \"search domains\" and are first used as search suffixes for extending single-label hostnames (hostnames containing no dots) to become fully qualified domain names (FQDNs). If a single-label hostname is resolved on this interface, each of the specified search domains are appended to it in turn, converting it into a fully qualified domain name, until one of them may be successfully resolved. Both \"search\" and \"routing-only\" domains are used for routing of DNS queries: look-ups for hostnames ending in those domains (hence also single label names, if any \"search domains\" are listed), are routed to the DNS servers configured for this interface. The domain routing logic is particularly useful on multi-homed hosts with DNS servers serving particular private DNS zones on each interface. The \"routing-only\" domain '~.' (the tilde indicating definition of a routing domain, the dot referring to the DNS root domain which is the implied suffix of all valid DNS names) has special effect. It causes all DNS traffic which does not match another configured domain routing entry to be routed to DNS servers specified for this interface. This setting is useful to prefer a certain set of DNS servers if a link on which they are connected is available. This setting is read by systemd-resolved.service8. \"Search domains\" correspond to the domain and search entries in resolv.conf5. Domain name routing has no equivalent in the traditional glibc API, which has no concept of domain name servers limited to a specific link."

If a single-label hostname is resolved on this interface, each of the specified search domains are appended to it in turn, converting it into a fully qualified domain name, until one of them may be successfully resolved. Both \"search\" and \"routing-only\" domains are used for routing of DNS queries: look-ups for hostnames ending in those domains (hence also single label names, if any \"search domains\" are listed), are routed to the DNS servers configured for this interface. The domain routing logic is particularly useful on multi-homed hosts with DNS servers serving particular private DNS zones on each interface. The \"routing-only\" domain '~.' (the tilde indicating definition of a routing domain, the dot referring to the DNS root domain which is the implied suffix of all valid DNS names) has special effect. It causes all DNS traffic which does not match another configured domain routing entry to be routed to DNS servers specified for this interface. This setting is useful to prefer a certain set of DNS servers if a link on which they are connected is available. This setting is read by systemd-resolved.service8. \"Search domains\" correspond to the domain and search entries in resolv.conf5.

Each item in the list should be a domain name, optionally prefixed with a tilde ('~'). The domains with the prefix are called \"routing-only domains\". The domains without the prefix are called \"search domains\" and are first used as search suffixes for extending single-label hostnames (hostnames containing no dots) to become fully qualified domain names (FQDNs). If a single-label hostname is resolved on this interface, each of the specified search domains are appended to it in turn, converting it into a fully qualified domain name, until one of them may be successfully resolved. Both \"search\" and \"routing-only\" domains are used for routing of DNS queries: look-ups for hostnames ending in those domains (hence also single label names, if any \"search domains\" are listed), are routed to the DNS servers configured for this interface. The domain routing logic is particularly useful on multi-homed hosts with DNS servers serving particular private DNS zones on each interface. The \"routing-only\" domain '~.' (the tilde indicating definition of a routing domain, the dot referring to the DNS root domain which is the implied suffix of all valid DNS names) has special effect. It causes all DNS traffic which does not match another configured domain routing entry to be routed to DNS servers specified for this interface. This setting is useful to prefer a certain set of DNS servers if a link on which they are connected is available. This setting is read by systemd-resolved.service8. \"Search domains\" correspond to the domain and search entries in resolv.conf5. Domain name routing has no equivalent in the traditional glibc API, which has no concept of domain name servers limited to a specific link."

When the rapid commit option is enabled by both the DHCPv6 client and the DHCPv6 server, the two-message exchange is used, rather than the default four-message exchange (solicit, advertise, request, and reply). The two-message exchange provides faster client configuration and is beneficial in environments in which networks are under a heavy load. See RFC 3315 for details. Defaults to true."

By default setting only the 'O' bit in Router Advertisements makes DHCPv6 request network information in a stateless manner using a two-message Information Request and Information Reply message exchange. RFC 7084, requirement WPD-4, updates this behavior for a Customer Edge router so that stateful DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation is also requested when only the 'O' bit is set in Router Advertisements. This option enables such a CE behavior as it is impossible to automatically distinguish the intention of the 'O' bit otherwise. By default this option is set to 'false', enable it if no prefixes are delegated when the device should be acting as a CE router."
