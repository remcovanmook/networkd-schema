LLDP emission is only available on Ethernet links. Note that this setting passes data suitable for identification of host to the network and should thus not be enabled on untrusted networks, where such identification data should not be made available. Use this option to permit other systems to identify on which interfaces they are connected to this system. The three special values control propagation of the LLDP packets. The 'nearest-bridge' setting permits propagation only to the nearest connected bridge, 'non-tpmr-bridge' permits propagation across Two-Port MAC Relays, but not any other bridges, and 'customer-bridge' permits propagation until a customer bridge is reached. For details about these concepts, see IEEE 802.1AB-2016. Note that configuring this setting to true is equivalent to 'nearest-bridge', the recommended and most restricted level of propagation.

The domains with the prefix are called \"routing-only domains\". The domains without the prefix are called \"search domains\" and are first used as search suffixes for extending single-label host names (host names containing no dots) to become fully qualified domain names (FQDNs). If a single-label host name is resolved on this interface, each of the specified search domains are appended to it in turn, converting it into a fully qualified domain name, until one of them may be successfully resolved. Both \"search\" and \"routing-only\" domains are used for routing of DNS queries: look-ups for host names ending in those domains (hence also single label names, if any \"search domains\" are listed), are routed to the DNS servers configured for this interface. The domain routing logic is particularly useful on multi-homed hosts with DNS servers serving particular private DNS zones on each interface. The \"routing-only\" domain '~.' (the tilde indicating definition of a routing domain, the dot referring to the DNS root domain which is the implied suffix of all valid DNS names) has special effect. It causes all DNS traffic which does not match another configured domain routing entry to be routed to DNS servers specified for this interface. This setting is useful to prefer a certain set of DNS servers if a link on which they are connected is available. This setting is read by systemd-resolved.service8. \"Search domains\" correspond to the domain and search entries in resolv.conf5. Domain name routing has no equivalent in the traditional glibc API, which has no concept of domain name servers limited to a specific link."
