This feature depends on ID_NET_NAME_* properties to exist for the link. On hardware where these properties are not set, the generation of a persistent MAC address will fail. If the kernel is using a random MAC address, nothing is done. Otherwise, a new address is randomly generated each time the device appears, typically at boot.

Note that specifying a name that the kernel might use for another interface (for example 'eth0') is dangerous because the name assignment done by udev will race with the assignment done by the kernel, and only one interface may use the name. Depending on the order of operations, either udev or the kernel will win, making the naming unpredictable. It is best to use some different prefix, for example 'internal0'/'external0' or 'lan0'/'lan1'/'lan3'. Interface names must have a minimum length of 1 character and a maximum length of 15 characters, and may contain any 7bit ASCII character, with the exception of control characters, ':', '/' and '%'.
